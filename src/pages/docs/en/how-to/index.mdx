How-to guides can be thought of as recipes, directions that guide the reader through the steps to achieve a specific end.
How-to guides — task oriented, practical steps, that serve our work

Examples could be: how to calibrate the radar array; how to use fixtures in pytest; how to configure reconnection back-off policies. On the other hand, how to build a web application is not — that’s not addressing a specific goal or problem, it’s a vastly open-ended sphere of skill.

How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do. A rich list of how-to guides is an encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

If they’re well-written and address the right subjects, you’re likely to find that how-to guides are the most-read sections of your documentation.
