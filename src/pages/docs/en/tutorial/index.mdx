A tutorial must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product, so that they can go on to use the product for their own purposes.

A tutorial also needs to show the learner that they can be successful with the product - by having them do something both meaningful and attainable.
Tutorials — learning-oriented guides that describe practical steps and are intended to serve our study.

A tutorial in other words is a lesson — a lesson concerned with learning how rather than learning that, because it’s concerned with skill: practical, not theoretical knowledge.

Having completed a tutorial, the learner should be in a position to start to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the product itself.

For a product, a tutorial turns new learners into users. An inadequate tutorial can prevent a project from acquiring new users.
