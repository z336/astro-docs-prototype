Explanation clarifies, deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject.
Explanation - understanding oriented, theoretical knowledge, that serves our study

It’s not concerned with what the user might be doing, like tutorials and how-to guides. It’s not a close-up view of the machinery, like reference material. It’s documentation that approaches a topic from a higher perspective, and from different angles.

This allows explanation to become discussion, a more relaxed, freer way to consider something. Explanation joins things together. It’s documentation that it makes sense to read while away from the product itself.
